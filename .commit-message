Library improvements and basic RSS parsing.

Introducing stream filters and streamstack for easier stream management.
- Filters operate on streams (or other filters), and produce modified
  input/output.
- A streamstack is built upon an endpoint (a stream communicating with
  hardware buffer), and accepts filters as upper level handlers.
  Streamstack is an iostream, that delegates message to lower levels.

Introducing HTTP client side interpreter (header parser) as a filter.

Introducing more efficient RSS parser, based on XML parser, and a basic
RSS library.

Modifying RSS reader, to use filters and the new parser.

Refactoring code and filesystem, hiding commit-message.
